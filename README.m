%% |arcasciiread.m|: Read data from an ESRI ASCII file
% Author: Kelly Kearney
%
% This repository includes the code for the |arcasciiread.m| and |plotarcascii.m| 
% Matlab functions, along with all dependent functions required to run them. 
%
% The |readarcascii| function reads all data from an ESRI ASCII grid file.
% This format is associated with various ESRI products, including ArcGIS,
% and holds the data defining a single raster grid.
%
% The |plotarcascii| function provides a convenient way to plot the data
% from one of these files.  It sets up a simple map axis and adds a
% surfacem plot of the data.
%
%% Getting started
%
% *Prerequisites*
%
% This function requires Matlab R14 or later.
%
% *Downloading and installation*
%
% This code can be downloaded from <https://github.com/kakearney/arcascii-pkg/ Github>
% or the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/
% MatlabCentral File Exchange>.  The File Exchange entry is updated daily
% from the GitHub repository.   
%
% *Matlab Search Path*
%
% The following folders need to be added to your Matlab Search path (via
% |addpath|, |pathtool|, etc.):
%
